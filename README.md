# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a java application that I wrote a year ago. It is the popular "TicTacToe" game, but I made it more flexible, so you can change the Win Value and the field size. With the "Win Value" I mean that for example, if you choose 5 as the Win Value, the player who has done first 5 X-es (O-s) wins, so the Win Value is free to choose. 
The interesting part of this application is the algorithm that I did on my own to find which player has won. It has the complexity of O(n).
